# Notes for the data engineering training on Google Cloud Platform

> This four-day instructor-led class provides participants a hands-on introduction to 
> designing and building data processing systems on Google Cloud Platform.

> Through a combination of presentations, demos, and hand-on labs, participants will learn 
> how to design data processing systems, build end-to-end data pipelines, analyze data and carry out machine learning.

> The course covers structured, unstructured, and streaming data.
